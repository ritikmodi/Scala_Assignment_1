Harvest
You are a fruit farm manager and you have several employees. Your employees gather fruits every day. Your task is to reward the best employees and drive your farm towards the best profitability. Of course, you can't do that without proper data.

There are two files: harvest.csv and prices.csv. First contains data on amounts of fruits collected by a given gatherer on a given day. The other contains fruit prices on a given day.

Before you make any decision, you need to know:

Who is your best gatherer in terms of the amounts of fruits gathered every month? Are there employees that are better at gathering some specific fruit?

What is your best-earning fruit (overall and by month)? Which is your least profitable fruit (again, overall and by month)?

Which gatherer contributed most to your income (during the whole year and by month)?

add bellow part to the question if you are testing only Scala knowledge

Although you could use spark to write the application or put the data into some database, we want to see how would you solve the task without it, using only scala. Still, you are allowed to use any other libraries like something for parsing csv files or program arguments, if you like, though the task should be solvable even without it.

The application should print answers to the console. 

Remember to provide instructions how to run the application.
